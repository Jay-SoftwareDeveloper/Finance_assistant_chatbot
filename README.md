#  Finance Assistant Chatbot ‚Äì Real-Time Expense Tracker 

This project is a simple and smart expense tracker powered by an AI chatbot. You can type in messages like "Add $50 for groceries today", and the app will understand it, extract the details, send them through Kafka, store everything in Azure SQL, and help you see your spending habits through a visual dashboard.

-  AI Chatbot to understand natural language inputs
- Real-time stream processing with Apache Kafka

### 3. Start local Kafka (for simulation)
Make sure Apache Kafka is installed. Then:
```bash
# In one terminal
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

# In another terminal
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

# Create topic
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic expenses --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

## Sample Input
You can type natural language like:
> Add $75 for shopping today  
> Add $20 for transport on 3rd April
- The app will figure out the category, amount, and date.

## ‚òÅAzure SQL Setup
In `azure_sql.py` update your connection string like this:
```python
connect_to_azure():
    DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};
    SERVER=your_server.database.windows.net;
    DATABASE=your_db;
    UID=your_user;
    PWD=your_password
```

Create `expenses` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE expenses (
    id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    amount FLOAT,
    category VARCHAR(100),
    date DATE
);
```

##  Dashboard Preview
A basic D3.js dashboard is included in the frontend. You can extend it to create more interactive charts and graphs based on your expense data.
